          This Privacy Policy explains how Electrical Estimator (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our web-based estimating application, websites, and related services (the “Service”).

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">2) Scope</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          This Policy covers personal information we collect from or about users of the Service, website visitors, and individuals who communicate with us (e.g., by email). It does not cover third-party websites or services that we do not control.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">3) Information we collect</h2>

        <h3 class="h6 mb-2">3.1 Information you provide</h3>

          <li><strong>Estimate data.</strong> Materials, DJE items, assemblies, notes, quantities, labor inputs, adjustments, saved estimates, exports, and related configuration/settings you choose to store.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing &amp; payment.</strong> Subscription selections, plan details, billing contact and address. Card data is processed by our payment processor (e.g., Stripe); we don’t store full card numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Support &amp; communications.</strong> Messages you send us (support requests, feedback), and related attachments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h6 mb-2">3.2 Information we collect automatically</h3>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li><strong>Usage &amp; device data.</strong> IP address, browser type/version, device identifiers, pages viewed, features used, time spent, referring/exit pages, timestamps, and error logs.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies, local storage, and similar.</strong> We use cookies and browser storage to keep you signed in, remember preferences, and improve reliability. We don’t use them to track you across unaffiliated websites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h6 mb-2">3.3 Information from other sources</h3>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li><strong>Service providers.</strong> Payment processors, email providers, hosting, logging/monitoring may provide information related to billing events, deliverability, reliability, or abuse prevention.</li>
          <li><strong>Organization admins.</strong> If you use the Service under an Organization, your admin may provide your email and basic profile to invite/manage your access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">4) How we use information (purposes)</h2>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>Provide and maintain the Service (authenticate you, load/save estimates, exports, account management).</li>
          <li>Process subscriptions and payments (via our payment processor).</li>
          <li>Secure and protect the Service (fraud, abuse, and incident detection; troubleshooting; auditing).</li>
          <li>Improve the Service (analytics, research, feature development; de-identified or aggregate metrics where possible).</li>
          <li>Communicate with you (service messages, security notices, support responses; with your consent where required for marketing).</li>
          <li>Comply with law and enforce our Terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-3">
          For EEA/UK users, our legal bases typically include contract (providing the Service), legitimate interests (security, improvement, fraud prevention), consent (cookies/marketing where required), and legal obligations.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">5) How we share information</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">We share information only as needed to operate and improve the Service or comply with law:</p>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li><strong>Service providers (processors).</strong> Hosting, database, storage/backup, content delivery, email, logging/monitoring, analytics, and payment processing—under contracts that require them to protect your data and use it only on our instructions.</li>
          <li><strong>Organization administrators.</strong> If you use the Service under an Organization, admins may see your name, email, role, and activity necessary for managing the account.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal and safety.</strong> To comply with applicable law, legal process, or government requests; to enforce our Terms; or to protect the rights, property, and safety of users and the public.</li>
          <li><strong>Business transfers.</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets (we’ll take steps to ensure the successor respects this Policy).</li>
          <li><strong>At your direction.</strong> When you ask us to share or export.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-3">
          We do not sell or “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. If this changes in the future, we will update this Policy and provide any required opt-out mechanisms.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">6) Cookies &amp; local storage</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We use strictly necessary cookies and browser storage (like localStorage) to keep you signed in, remember preferences, and maintain reliability. If we add analytics or additional cookie categories in the future, we will provide a cookie notice and choices where required.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">You can control cookies via your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect core functionality.</p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">7) Data retention</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          We retain personal information for as long as your Account is active or as needed to provide the Service, resolve disputes, and comply with legal obligations. When you request deletion or close your Account, we delete or anonymize your data within a commercially reasonable period. Backups may persist for a limited time in secure storage and are deleted in the ordinary course.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">8) Security</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data we process, including encryption in transit (TLS), access controls, monitoring, and regular backups. No system is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">9) Your choices &amp; rights</h2>

        <h3 class="h6 mb-2">9.1 All users</h3>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li><strong>Access, correction, deletion.</strong> You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information by emailing <a href="mailto:support@electriciansmentor.com">support@electriciansmentor.com</a>. If you belong to an Organization, we may ask you to work through your admin for certain requests.</li>
          <li><strong>Exports.</strong> You can export certain Estimate data (e.g., CSV/PDF) using in-product features.</li>
          <li><strong>Communications.</strong> You can opt out of non-essential emails by using unsubscribe links or contacting us. Service and security emails are necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h6 mb-2">9.2 EEA/UK users</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          You may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to processing, and data portability, and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Where we rely on legitimate interests, you can object and we will consider your request in line with applicable law.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h6 mb-2">9.3 California residents (CPRA/CCPA)</h3>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Notice at collection.</strong> We collect identifiers (e.g., name, email, IP), commercial information (plan, billing history), internet/usage data (logs, device info), and professional information (company/role). We use these for the purposes in Section 4 and retain them as described in Section 7.</p>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Sensitive personal information.</strong> We process account login credentials to provide the Service; we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for additional purposes that require a right to limit.</p>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Sale/Share.</strong> We do not sell or “share” personal information (as defined by California law).</p>
        <p class="mb-3"><strong>Rights.</strong> You may request access, correction, deletion, and information about our data practices, and you have the right to non-discrimination for exercising these rights. Submit requests to <a href="mailto:support@electriciansmentor.com">support@electriciansmentor.com</a>. We will verify your identity (and, if applicable, authority of an agent) as required by law.</p>

        <h3 class="h6 mb-2">9.4 Do Not Track &amp; Global Privacy Control</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Many browsers offer “Do Not Track.” There’s no common standard, but if we engage in practices that constitute “sale” or “sharing” under applicable law, we will honor Global Privacy Control signals as an opt-out where required.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">10) International data transfers</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          We are based in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the U.S., your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the U.S. and other countries where we or our providers operate. We take steps to protect transfers as required by law.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">11) Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">12) Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., email or in-app). Your continued use after the effective date means you accept the revised Policy.
        </p>
