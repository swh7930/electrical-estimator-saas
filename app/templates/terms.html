        <p>The Service (including software, UI, designs, and documentation) is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by IP laws. You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service during your Subscription. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works of the Service except to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by law.</p>

        <p>The Service may integrate with third-party services (e.g., payment processors, email providers). Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.</p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">8) Disclaimers; No Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>The Service assists with estimating. It does not constitute engineering, legal, financial, or compliance advice. You are solely responsible for verifying quantities, codes, labor assumptions, material pricing, and outputs before relying on them for bids or contracts.</p>
        <p class="mb-0"><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">9) Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER WE NOR OUR SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in that case, the limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.</p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">10) Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from and against any third-party claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your (or your Users’) misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">11) Suspension &amp; Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate access immediately if you breach these Terms, fail to pay, or if your use risks the security or operation of the Service. You may cancel at any time in the app’s billing settings (or by contacting support) and your access will continue until the end of the current paid period.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, you should export your Estimate Data before your access ends. We may delete remaining data after a reasonable period, subject to Section 4.5.</p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">12) Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms. For material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., email or in-app). Changes apply prospectively, and your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

        <h2 class="h5 mt-4 mb-2">13) Governing Law &amp; Venue</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of law. You and we agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California.</p>

        <p><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms (and Policies referenced here) are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>No Waiver.</strong> Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</p>
        <p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary; the remainder will stay in effect.</p>
        <p><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset transfer.</p>
