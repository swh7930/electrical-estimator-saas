# S3-03b.7 — Export Services (PDF & CSV)

## Plan (checklist)
- [ ] HF1 — Stop-the-bleed: remove route math; scaffold Saved GET + Fast POST; basic validators; temporary minimal output.
- [ ] HF2 — PDF = exact Summary via shared partial; CSV uses the same data shape (no route math).
- [ ] HF3 — Unify storage keys (namespaced `ee.<EID>` + `ee.FAST`) and bus events (`ee:totals:changed`, `ee:reset`).
- [ ] HF4 — Summary & Adjustments wired to unified events; reset semantics fixed.
- [ ] HF5 — Export buttons: GET when EID present (Saved), POST when no EID (Fast); clarified tooltips; zero route math.
- [ ] HF6 — pdf.css polish; full smoke battery; tidy.
